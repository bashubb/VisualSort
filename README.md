# VisualSort üìä

VisualSort is an iOS app built with SwiftUI, designed to provide real-time visualization of various sorting algorithms. The app allows users to interactively observe sorting operations and control parameters like algorithm type, animation speed, and data size. Developed as a final project for CS50x, VisualSort leverages knowledge gained from the course to create an engaging and educational tool for learning sorting algorithms.

## Features üöÄ

- **Real-time Visualization**: See sorting algorithms in action with interactive visualizations.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort for comparison and learning.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Control animation speed and data size for a customizable experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive controls make it easy to use for learners and enthusiasts alike.

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Launch the app and select a sorting algorithm from the options provided.
2. Adjust the animation speed and data size sliders as desired.
3. Tap the "Step" button to execute a single step of the sorting algorithm.
4. Use the "Shuffle" button to randomize the data set.
5. Observe the sorting process in real-time and enjoy experimenting with different parameters.

## Educational Resource üìö

VisualSort serves as an educational resource for learning about sorting algorithms. It's a valuable tool for students, developers, and educators to understand and visualize the intricacies of sorting methods.


## Plans for the Future üìà

- **Expansion of Sorting Algorithms**: Continuously add new sorting algorithms to the app to provide a comprehensive learning experience. Consider including algorithms like Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Algorithm Comparisons**: Implement features for comparing different sorting algorithms side by side, allowing users to visualize and understand their differences in performance and behavior.
- **Educational Content**: Enhance the app with educational content such as explanations, tutorials, and quizzes to help users grasp the concepts behind each sorting algorithm.
- **Platform Expansion**: Explore the possibility of porting VisualSort to other platforms like macOS and iPadOS to reach a wider audience of learners and educators.
